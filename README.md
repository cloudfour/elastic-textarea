# Elastic Textarea

_A web component for progressively-enhanced auto-expanding textareas._

This web component progressively enhances the native textarea: as a user types in the textarea, its height increases so that its content is never clipped. When the user deletes content in the textarea it shrinks back down to a minimum number of rows.
